# Netflix Data Science Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Netflix's data using a range of data science techniques. It covers the entire data science pipeline, from data preprocessing to building predictive models, with an emphasis on user behavior and recommendation systems.
- **Understanding trends in content availability.
- **Analyzing viewing patterns or ratings.
- **Gaining insights into Netflix's catalog, user behavior, or performance.

## Key Features
- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loading the dataset and performing data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and patterns within the dataset, such as user ratings, movie genres, and viewing habits.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the existing data to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Implementing machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Collaborative Filtering to predict user preferences and make recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
